        <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>As the final project for my Advanced Web Development class, my team was tasked with building a React.js website that met professional design standards and integrated at least two API calls. This was a culmination of all the work we had done beforehand. Otherwise, we had free reign as to the purpose of the website. Everyone in my group was intrigued by the idea of collecting and displaying stats for Spotify users, as we all regularly used Spotify. So we decided on <strong>Spotify Unwrapped</strong>, which would display our users' most listened to tracks and artists to their friends.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>I typically take on the role of designer and project coordinator in group projects, but for this project, I challenged myself by focusing on the backend and API integrations. The app required authentication and data collection via the Spotify Developer API, along with a backend database to store user profiles and social data. I selected Supabase, an open source Firebase alternative, for its excellent documentation and ease of use. </p>

        <h2>Silent Deprecation Problems</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Initially, we wanted to display the users top genres in addition to their top tracks and artists. However, I noticed some songs were not given genres by Spotify. On further investigation I learned Spotify was silently deprecating its genre system from their API. I explored alternative APIs to retrieve genre information, but none could deliver the speed or reliability we needed.  This challenge highlighted how quickly platform capabilities can change; just six months earlier, this wouldn’t have been a problem.

        <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>This was one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. I stepped outside my usual role, gained valuable backend experience, and ultimately contributed to a polished, fully functional product. Our group received a 100% for the project.
