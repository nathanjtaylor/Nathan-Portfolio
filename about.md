In May 2025, I will graduate from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Information Science, and minors in Information Technology; Computer Science; and Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. There’s nothing more satisfying to me than a well-designed digital experience—I love building solutions that are both functional and intuitive.

During my time at university, I have worked on projects that have allowed me to apply and develop skills in:
 - Web Development - HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, React, Decap CMS
 - User Experience Research & Design - Qualtrics, User Interviews, Figma, and data collection techniques
 - Data Analysis & Visualization - R, Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
 - Software Development - Python, C++
 - Algorithm Design - Data structures, sorting algorithms, complexity analysis
 - Accessibility Design - WCAG compliance, designing for inclusivity, usability testing for diverse users
 - Project Management – Agile methodologies, task prioritization, team collaboration tools (Miro, Teams)

Beyond academics, I have been actively involved in MSU’s campus community. For three years, I served as the president of the Tabletop Club, leading my e-board to create a welcoming space where students could unwind and connect through games. I also volunteered regularly through Spartan Day of Service and played saxophone in the Campus Symphonic Band.

In addition to my leadership and volunteer work, I have participated in various programming events, including:
- 2023 MSU Game Jam
- SpartaHack 9 (2024)
- SpartaHack X (2025), where my team won the *New Horizons Frontier Award*
- Designathon (2025)

I am passionate about work that has the potential to make a positive impact, and I’m seeking full-time opportunities at organizations committed to delivering the best possible experience for their users.
