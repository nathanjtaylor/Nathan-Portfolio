# Projects
## Web Design & Development
### <a href="https://woodmancustomconstruction.com/" target="_blank">Woodman Custom Construction</a>
I worked with Woodman Custom Construction to create a professional portfolio website that showcases their services and projects. The goal was to design a simple, user-friendly site the owner could easily upload new projects to. This was achieved through the integration of Decap CMS on a Netlify-hosted platform. As my first experience working with content management systems, this project provided an invaluable learning opportunity.

### Sports Data Management System
I developed a script to integrate a Google Form with Google Sheets for a Fantasy Football Manager, streamlining the process of managing their tournament. I worked closely with the manager to understand their specific needs and researched the most efficient solution to ensure a seamless experience for both participants and the manager. The final solution was well-received, with participants praising the simplicity of the form and the manager noting the significant time saved in organizing and tracking the tournament.

### Portfolio Iterations
This is the third iteration of my portfolio, reflecting significant growth in both my design and development skills. Over time, Iâ€™ve refined my approach to creating more intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and functional designs. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my continuous development of my abilities.

## User Experience

### Independent Study
I completed an independent study under the guidance of Professor Jeff Siarto, where I focused on improving my survey creation skills. As part of the study, I conducted six interviews with individuals who manage medical conditions to better understand the challenges they face. By analyzing their feedback, I identified common issues and insights. I then used these findings to develop a simple web application designed to help users keep track of their medication refills.

### Collaborative Telehealth Prototype
I worked on a semester-long collaborative project with students from Michigan State University and Egerton University in Kenya to develop technology solutions for use in Kenya. Our team, which included a member based at Egerton, designed a physical prototype of a telehealth kiosk aimed at connecting remote communities with medical consultations and medications, overcoming challenges such as limited access to specialists and quality clinics. Afterward, we partnered with a Kenyan designer to create a high-fidelity version of the prototype.

### MSU Maps Prototype
In my prototyping class, I collaborated with a team to develop a prototype for an app aimed at improving the campus experience for new Michigan State students. The app would help students navigate to their classrooms by plotting the best route on a map and suggesting places to eat along the way. I was involved in the creation of the Figma prototype, where I honed my skills in symbol creation and refining user interface elements.
