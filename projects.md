# Projects
## Web Design & Development
### Woodman Custom Construction
I worked with Woodman Custom Construction to create a professional portfolio website that showcases their services and projects. The goal was to design a simple, user-friendly site the owner could easily upload new projects to. This was achieved through the integration of Decap CMS on a Netlify-hosted platform. As my first experience working with content management systems, this project provided an invaluable learning opportunity.

### Sports Data Management System
I developed a script to integrate a Google Form with Google Sheets for a Fantasy Football Manager, streamlining the process of managing their tournament. I worked closely with the manager to understand their specific needs and researched the most efficient solution to ensure a seamless experience for both participants and the manager. The final solution was well-received, with participants praising the simplicity of the form and the manager noting the significant time saved in organizing and tracking the tournament.



### MSU Hollander Makerspace Assessment Capabilites
I was a part of a group that worked to add assessment capabilities to the Makerspace's website. This would allow them to better understand how their services were being used. This opportunity came about from the Information Technology minor, specifically a semester long project in the capstone class. In the end, the clients were impressed with our work which is currently being implemented onto the website.

## User Experience

### Independent Study
I completed an independent study under the guidance of Professor Jeff Siarto, where I focused on improving my survey creation skills. As part of the study, I conducted six interviews with individuals who manage medical conditions to better understand the challenges they face. By analyzing their feedback, I identified common issues and insights. I then used these findings to develop a simple web application designed to help users keep track of their medication refills.

### Collaborative Telehealth Prototype
I worked on a semester-long collaborative project with students from Michigan State University and Egerton University in Kenya to develop technology solutions for use in Kenya. Our team, which included a member based at Egerton, designed a physical prototype of a telehealth kiosk aimed at connecting remote communities with medical consultations and medications, overcoming challenges such as limited access to specialists and quality clinics. Afterward, we partnered with a Kenyan designer to create a high-fidelity version of the prototype.

### MSU Maps Prototype
In my prototyping class, I collaborated with a team to develop a prototype for an app aimed at improving the campus experience for new Michigan State students. The app would help students navigate to their classrooms by plotting the best route on a map and suggesting places to eat along the way. I was involved in the creation of the Figma prototype, where I honed my skills in symbol creation and refining user interface elements.
